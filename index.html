    <h1>
      GET OUT
    </h1>
    Verse 1:
Yo, I gotta vent, gotta let this out,
You drive me crazy, there's no doubt.
Every time you talk, it's like nails on a chalkboard,
Your voice in my head, a relentless discord.

You act all tough, but you ain't got a clue,
Always in my business, what I do, who I knew.
Fake as a smile on a politician's face,
Can't stand your lies, man, you’re a disgrace.

Chorus:
I can't stand you, no, I can't fake it,
Every single word, I just can't take it.
You push my buttons, you make me see red,
Living rent-free, man, get outta my head.

Verse 2:
Your ego's so big, it don't fit in the room,
You think you're the sun, but you're just a cartoon.
Always got drama, you're a walking storm,
Causing chaos and pain, that's your norm.

You play the victim, always the same old game,
But everyone knows you’re the one to blame.
Talking behind backs, spreading that hate,
But karma’s coming for you, better check your fate.

Chorus:
I can't stand you, no, I can't fake it,
Every single word, I just can't take it.
You push my buttons, you make me see red,
Living rent-free, man, get outta my head.

Bridge:
I’m done with the lies, done with your games,
Sick of your face, sick of your names.
This is the end, my final goodbye,
No more chances, no more alibis.

Chorus:
I can't stand you, no, I can't fake it,
Every single word, I just can't take it.
You push my buttons, you make me see red,
Living rent-free, man, get outta my head.

Outro:
So here’s to the end, you’re outta my life,
Cut you out clean, like a sharp knife.
No more drama, no more pain,
Just peace in my mind, sunshine after rain.
